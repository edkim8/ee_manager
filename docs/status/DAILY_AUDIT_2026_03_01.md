## 5. Warnings

### W1 — OB: 2 Silent Drops (Threshold Met ⚠️)

OB had 2 silently-dropped tenancies in this run:
- 1 transitioned → **Past** (natural lease expiry, removed from Yardi without event)
- 1 transitioned → **Canceled** (tenancy disappeared without status transition)
- 1 unit availability reset → **Available** (from the Canceled record)

Threshold rule: > 1 silent drop at any single property in one run requires flagging. Available count held at 22 — net change is neutral. Monitor next run. If drops continue, investigate OB for data issues.

### W2 — Transfer Flag UNKNOWN Persists ⚠️

Phase 2E still logs `"No new transfer flags to create for UNKNOWN (all already exist)"` despite the `from_property_code` fallback fix committed 2026-02-28 (`5ef3b56`).

Root cause is likely **stale DB records**: existing `unit_flags` rows with `property_code = 'UNKNOWN'` from before the fix are matching the dedup check, preventing new records from being created. The actual flag data is intact and no duplicates were created.

**Action for next session:** Query `unit_flags` where `flag_type = 'transfer'` and `property_code = 'UNKNOWN'` — update them to the correct `from_property_code` values, or investigate if Phase 2E dedup check needs to be updated alongside the staging fix.

### W3 — CV C213: Day 25 Overdue (Critical ⚠️)

C213 has been MakeReady-overdue since 2026-02-04. No Yardi resolution in 25 days.

**New development:** Taub, Timothy appeared today as an Applicant for C213 (lease_start_date 2026-03-13, rent $2,654). If this application converts, the unit will move out of the MakeReady queue naturally. Watch next run.

| History | Days |
|---------|------|
| H-058 (2026-02-24) | Day 20 |
| H-059 (2026-02-25) | Day 21 |
| H-060 (2026-02-26) | Day 22 |
| 2026-02-28 | Day 25 |
| **Today** | **Day 25** |

---

## 6. MakeReady Flag Status

| Unit | Property | Days Overdue | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| C213 | CV | 25 | ⚠️ Critical — Applicant Taub in pipeline (2026-03-13) |
| C311 | CV | 10 | Ongoing |
| C217 | CV | 9 | Ongoing |
| C229 | CV | 4 | Ongoing |
| **C230** | **CV** | **2** | **NEW today** — Cedillo applicant (2026-03-07) |
| 2007 | RS | 3 | Stable (existing) |
| 1027 | RS | 3 | Stable (existing) |
| 3061 | RS | 3 | Stable (existing) |
| S081 | OB | 5 | Stable (existing) |

CV has 5 concurrent MakeReady flags — most of any property.

## 7. Move-Out Overdue (Phase 2D.5)

- 3 overdue move-outs processed
- 2 new flags created
- 1 existing flag severity-escalated

Unit identities not individually logged. Query to identify:
```sql
SELECT unit_name, property_code, metadata, created_at
FROM unit_flags
WHERE flag_type = 'move_out_overdue'
  AND (created_at::date = '2026-03-01' OR updated_at::date = '2026-03-01')
ORDER BY property_code, unit_name;
```

## 8. W1 Watch — Notices Fix Stability (Day 3) ✓ STABLE

All three watch tenancies processed correctly as Future (no Notice corruption):

| Resident | Unit | Property | Rent | Status |
|----------|------|----------|------|--------|
| Kenton, Christina | 2019 | RS | $1,835 | ✓ Future → lease created |
| Jeffers, Ryan | 3130 | RS | $1,200 | ✓ Future → lease created |
| Poorman, Timothy | 1015 | SB | $1,753 | ✓ Future → lease created |

W1 fix confirmed stable through Day 3. Monitoring continues.

## 9. Minor Notes

- **OB S100 — Yardi data entry typo:** Arreola Garcia, Pedro I has `lease_start_date = 2102-05-22` (should be 2026-05-22). Future tenancy still processed correctly against valid `lease_end_date: 2027-02-28`. Notify Yardi team to correct.
- **Delinquency resolutions:** RS −4, SB −4, OB −1. Positive trend continuing from prior week.
- **Alerts:** CV +1 new alert, RS +1 new alert. No alert removals across all properties.
- **Work Orders:** CV deactivated 4, SB deactivated 4. All others stable.
